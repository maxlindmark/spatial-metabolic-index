# Local biomass trends of demersal fish in the Baltic Sea explained by metabolic index velocities
This repo contains data and R code for collating cpue data by length for cod, flounder, plaice and dab, fitting metabolic index parameters, fitting species distribution models using [sdmTMB](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB), and calculating metabolic index velocities.
